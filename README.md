Degusto Food Studio - B2B Corporate Lunch Services

Overview
Degusto Food Studio is improving corporate lunch service offerings by growing its recently launched B2B website. Degusto struggles with client involvement and market awareness while producing high-quality items. Our data-driven strategy is to improve communication tactics and product offerings in order to foster more business partnerships.

Problem

Degusto's lack of engagement tactics makes it difficult for the company to become visible to prospective corporate clients. This difficulty has impacted client acquisition and growth by making it challenging to properly communicate the company's benefits to the intended demographic.

Solution

Our data-driven strategy will include the following:
Product enhancement: Creating lunch combinations that are visually appealing by examining previous sales data.
Improved Communication: Employing site scraping to obtain information about possible client organisations in order to implement automated, targeted, and customised email exchanges.

Expected Outcomes

Our strategies are intended to:
Boost Business Partnerships: Improving Communication with Possible B2B Customers.
Increasing customer satisfaction via making data-driven adjustments to communications and products provided. 

For further expectations we plan to apply A/B testing to increase conversion rates, using metrics such as email response rates and effectiveness of the created newsletter types.

Contribution

This project is not only a solution for Degusto but also serves as a versatile framework that can be adapted for use in other B2B restaurant services or product optimization challenges. Organizations looking to leverage similar strategies can customize this framework by integrating their specific business requirements and historical data.
