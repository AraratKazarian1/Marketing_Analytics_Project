## Problem

	Degusto Food Studio has confronted with a challenge trying to expand its the newly introduced B2B website’s clientele for coorporate lunch service market. Despite the already existing value offerings and product quality, the company has faced an issue regarding visibility among potential clients in the market. As we see the crux of the problem is due to insufficient engagement strategies, which fail to represent company’s benefits to target audience and attract them. This has affected the company's growth more challenging to acquire new customers. 

## Solution

	To solve the mentioned issue, we have planed to adopt a data-driven approach for Degusto that encompasses product development and customer acquisition strategies. The solution involves two main components: enhancing product offerings through the analysis of historical sales data and optimizing communication through authomated targeted and personalized email interactions. Specific actions include using web scraping to gather data on potential clients(companies), analyzing customer preferences and buying patterns to develop appealing lunch combos, and refining marketing communications to increase engagement and conversion rates through intentionally targeting our selected companies as potential clients.

## Expected Outcomes

	An increase in corporate collaborations is expected as a result of these methods, which are expected to significantly improve interaction from potential B2B clients. Degusto hopes to see increased customer satisfaction among current customers and greater conversion rates from new interactions by customising goods and messaging based on data-driven insights. For furtehr improvements it will be possible to use the project not only for degusto but also for other restaurant businesses using particular metrics to utilize success, such as email campaign response rates and A/B testing results that show how effective various newsletter styles are
